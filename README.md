# Lease Management System

# UseCase:

Lease Management System is a smart contract where the owner of the contract can add different Renters. These renters can then list their properties in lease. Rentee can look into all the properties which are available and can lease any of the given properties. 5% of rent paid to the Renter goes to the Owner of the contract.

# Requirements:

## Owner of the contract

- None

## Renter Role

- Can add multiple flats or houses for lease
- Can terminate the lease. If renter accepted the rentee then renter can terminate the contract only if rentee defaults on rent.
- Can accept rentee, If request for lease is raised by rentee and then renter need to accept that request inorder to rent property to rentee
- Can reject rentee, If request for lease is raised by rentee and then renter need to reject that request inorder to make its property available for other rentee

## Rentee Role:

- Pay rent to the Renter if it is rented by the Rentee.
- Can propose to buy a property and submit security and first monthâ€™s pay in the contract.
- Once the contract is terminated Rentee is not allowed to pay rent.
